Hi all! My first name is Ian but I go by my middle - Avery.

#### Interests
In my current iteration I am a M.S. student in Environmental Engineering at Stanford. Much of my recent work stems from involvement with the <a href="http://sus.stanford.edu/courses/#224xyz"> Sustainable Urban Systems program</a> as an independent researcher and a teaching assistant where I build flood risk models and apply geospatial data to study urban systems. I also work as a GIS analyst at the non-profit City Systems. Other active interests include microbial applications to remediation and chemical production as well as the effects of climate change and urbanization on water supply and quality.
